GOALS
=====

I'm a lazy programmer. And so is the feature:

    As a lazy programmer
    I want to write minimal code of tasks (Elegant code)
    In order to have the tasks running the way I need
    And / or able to customize the tasks that I want in a more simple and elegant way

<b> Morpheus says: You have to let it all go. Fear, doubt, and disbelief. Free your mind. </b>

The purposes of the project are:

- Remove duplication of tasks.
- Have a Domain Specific Language to 'shape' tasks.
- Refactor all the tasks.
- Make the code of creating tasks, more cleaner.
- Making people to write the smallest possible number of code to create tasks that exist in the Ruby community.
- Create conventions of writing tasks (remember - Convention Over Configuration)
- Create a very easy way to test task very easily
